SETUP:
So first you want to have Windows (i think this works with almost every version... but a modern one like Windows 11 or Windows 10 is mostly reccomended)
Then you want to download the latest Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and go trough the Setup process
After your done downloading Python open the **neko.bat** file
Now that you have CMD open you can see the commands and stuff
neko generate Prompt - Basically generates an AI image using https://pollinations.ai/ and displays it inside of CMD
neko list - doesnt do anything... idk why its there
neko image open - opens an image (replace image with the file name and extension)
exit - Do i need to explain?
you can use CD to browse around your computer and DIR to list all the files in the current directory
And as i said this supports GIF's even if theyre animated!

**OH AND ALSO: Press ctrl + - to zoom out if you're viewing a GIF or photo so that it doesnt look so weird and broken**

Have fun using this! Report all bugs to me or just recommend features if you want
